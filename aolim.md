# AOL Instant Messenger

AOL launched their instant messenger in 1997 and it changed messenging for an entire generation. It dominated the IM market in North American, with millions choosing AIM over  alternatives such as ICQ or MSM. If you're too young to remember these pieces of software then do a quick search or check them out on YouTube.

The second app we're going to buid will be **T**hunkable **I**nstant **M**essenger, or TIM for short.

## How it works

The user interface is simple, and deliberately so. In essence all we need is a label, a button and a textbox. To get up and running quickly we'll use [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to handle incoming and outgoing messages. You don't need a firebase account to get the demo working, but if you plan on publishing your app to the Play Store then you should really [sign up](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for your own account.
